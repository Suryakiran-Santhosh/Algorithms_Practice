This is Professor Norman Matloffs Sample Interview Question. 
Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:

    Input: "aaaabbbcca"
    Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)]

Write a function that converts the input to the output. I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes. How would you solve it?
